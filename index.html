    <h3>Previous Experience</h3>
    <p>I was the managing editor and director of operations of <a href="http://www.disinfo.com">The Disinformation Company</a>, an independent media machine with active book, video and online publishing efforts. My core responsibilities included editorial, design, production and website management, as well as marketing and strategy. In addition to managing a number of interesting personalities and freelancers over the years, I am always capable of getting my hands "dirty": actually doing the hard work in the trenches that provides little glory but is necessary for a business to thrive.</p>

    <p>If there is a problem to be solved, I can figure it out. I am able to find a path to a solution, or quickly recognize when there is not an easy resolution. I have a proven track record of learning new skills and completing projects as necessary for the continued success of any team.</p>

    <p>I am proficient in the use of various programs used in print and electronic publishing, video editing and web design. I am able to learn new software quickly and instruct others in its use.</p>
